Data Extraction: Collected the dataset from superdatascience.com
Explorartory Analysis of features available in the dataset : Identifying missing values, categorical variable encoding, correlation analysis
Data preparation- 
Feature Scaling: As KNN uses euclidean distance as similarity measure, age and salary variables are normalized before used in the modeling
Training and test sets
The Actual KNN model
